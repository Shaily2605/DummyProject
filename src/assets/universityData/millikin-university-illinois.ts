The university is known for its commitment to experiential learning, offering a variety of hands-on experiences for students in the classroom and beyond.</p> <p>The university's beginnings can be traced back to 1901, when James Millikin, a successful Decatur businessman, gifted his family's mansion and large tracts of land to create Millikin University. The gift included a $100,000 donation, which became the university's endowment. Millikin's mission was to create a university that provided education to young men and women on an equal basis.</p> <p>Millikin opened its doors to students in 1903 and has since grown to become one of the largest private universities in Illinois. The university offers more than 50 undergraduate majors and 11 graduate programs, and it has an enrollment of more than 3,000 students. Millikin is known for its commitment to experiential learning, offering hands-on experiences for students in the classroom and beyond, such as internship and research opportunities, study abroad programs, and service learning projects.
