The college has an enrollment of about 1,400 students and a faculty of approximately 200.</p> <p>Reed was founded in 1908 by philanthropist and industrialist Simeon Gannett Reed. Reed's goal was to create an educational institution that would provide an education of the highest quality to young men and women regardless of their economic background. To that end, Reed was the first college in the Pacific Northwest to admit students regardless of race or gender.</p> <p>Reed's early curriculum emphasized a strong foundation in the humanities, sciences, and languages. The college also created one of the first interdisciplinary programs in the United States, the Humanities Program. This program combined the study of literature, philosophy, and history, and encouraged students to explore a wide range of subjects.</p> <p>In recent years, Reed has taken a leadership role in sustainability, becoming the first college in the nation to require all of its students to take a class in sustainability. The college has also taken steps to reduce its environmental footprint, such as installing solar panels and adopting green building practices.</p> <p>Reed College has a long and proud history of educating some of the nation's brightest minds. It is consistently ranked among the top liberal arts colleges in the country, and its alumni have gone on to have successful careers in many fields.</p>"
