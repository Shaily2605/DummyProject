            data: "<p><b>Wilson College</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1869, it is the oldest independent college for women in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>The college was founded by the Reverend Isaac Wilson, a Presbyterian minister and abolitionist who served in the Civil War. Wilson was inspired by the progressive ideals of the day, including the belief that women should have access to higher education. He purchased a farm near Chambersburg to serve as the site of the college and recruited a faculty of five teachers.</p> <p>The college opened its doors in 1869 with an enrollment of 86 students. It offered classes in English, Latin, German, mathematics, sciences, and music. In the following decades, Wilson College grew and expanded its curriculum, introducing degree programs in history, economics, sociology, and religion in the 1890s.</p> <p>Today Wilson College offers over 30 undergraduate majors and minors, along with several graduate programs. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.
