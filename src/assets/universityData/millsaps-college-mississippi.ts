            data: "<p><b>Millsaps College</b> is a private liberal arts college in Jackson, Mississippi. Founded in 1890 by a Confederate veteran and Methodist minister, it is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. It has a long history of service to the Jackson and Mississippi communities, producing leaders in the fields of education, government, business, and the arts.</p> <p>Millsaps College began as a small school in downtown Jackson, called the Millsaps Collegiate Institute. The school was named after its benefactor, Major Reuben Webster Millsaps, a successful Jackson businessman and a Confederate veteran. The school was originally housed in an old building on the corner of Farish and President Streets.</p> <p>In 1897, the school was moved to its current location on the historic College Hill, which was then the site of a plantation owned by the Chambers family. The Chambers family donated the land for the new campus and the school was renamed Millsaps College.</p> <p>Over the next several decades, Millsaps College grew in stature and influence. It became the first college in Mississippi to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the first to offer a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1909, the college also established the first student newspaper in Mississippi.</p> <p>Today, Millsaps College is known for its rigorous academic programs, its commitment to community engagement and service, and its strong sense of campus life. With a student body of just over 1,000, the college prides itself on its small size, which allows for close relationships between students and faculty. The college has produced prominent leaders in business, government, education, and the arts throughout its history, and it continues to be a leader in higher education today.</p>"
