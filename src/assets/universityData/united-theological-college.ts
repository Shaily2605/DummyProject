The college provides training and education for aspiring ministers, as well as other laypeople. UTC has a long and distinguished history, having served the church in Wales for over 150 years.</p> <p>UTC began as a small college in 1864, located in a house in Brynawelon. It was founded by the United Reformed Church, which had been formed two years earlier by the union of the Presbyterian Church of England and the Congregational Union of England and Wales. The first Principal of the college was Rev. William Williams, and the first students were mostly from Wales.</p> <p>In 1885, the college moved to its current site in Aberystwyth, and in 1895 it was granted a Royal Charter, allowing it to award degrees. Over the years, the college has grown in size and reputation, and today it provides training and education to a wide range of students, both local and international.</p> <p>UTC remains a distinctive theological college, providing quality training and education to those who wish to pursue a career in ministry or in other aspects of church life.
