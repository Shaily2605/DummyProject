            data: "<p><b>South University, Tampa</b>, Florida, was founded in 1899 as a small, private college. It originally focused on providing education to women and minorities who might not have had access to a higher education otherwise. It was located in downtown Tampa in the early days and is now located near the city’s industrial district.</p> <p>In the mid-20th century, South University began to expand its curriculum, adding degrees in management, nursing and other health-related fields. In 1995, the university received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).</p> <p>In 1999, South University was acquired by the Education Management Corporation (EDMC), a private education provider. EDMC invested heavily in the university, helping it to expand its academic programs, hire new faculty and staff, and increase the size of its campus.</p> <p>In 2018, South University celebrated its 120th anniversary. To mark the occasion, EDMC announced a major renovation project that would see the university double its size and add new buildings, academic programs and student services.</p> <p>Today, South University offers a range of undergraduate and graduate degrees in business, health science and other fields. It also offers online learning options for students who are unable to attend classes on campus. The university continues to be committed to providing a high-quality education to all of its students.</p>"
