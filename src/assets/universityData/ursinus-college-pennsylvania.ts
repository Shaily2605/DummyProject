It was founded by a group of German Reformed pastors and laymen led by Reverend John Henry Augustus Bomberger. The college adopted its name from the 16th-century German humanist and theologian Zacharias Ursinus, who was the primary author of the Heidelberg Catechism.</p> <p>The college began with 21 students in a rented house and a single instructor. Today, the college offers more than 50 majors and minors, and is the only independent college in Pennsylvania that offers a doctoral degree in physical therapy. The college is also home to the Ursinus College Arboretum, an arboretum and public garden that includes a collection of over 2,000 species of plants, trees, and shrubs.</p>"
