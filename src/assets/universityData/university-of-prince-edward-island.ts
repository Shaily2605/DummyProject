In 1912, the Prince of Wales College offered its first university degree, and in 1925, it became an accredited university. In 1931, St. Dunstan's University was granted the authority to grant degrees, and in 1949, it awarded its first Doctor of Science degree.</p> <p>During the 1960s, the two institutions began to collaborate more closely. In 1965, the two schools established a joint Senate, and in 1969, they merged to form the University of Prince Edward Island.</p> <p>Today, UPEI is a thriving institution with over 4,500 full-time students, over 1,000 part-time students, and more than 300 full-time faculty members.
