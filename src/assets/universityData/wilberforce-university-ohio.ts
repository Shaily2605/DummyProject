            data: "<p><b>Wilberforce University</b> is a private historically black university located in Wilberforce, Ohio. It was the first private, coed college in the United States to be owned and operated by African Americans. Founded in 1856 by the African Methodist Episcopal Church, it was named after William Wilberforce, the British statesman and philanthropist who fought to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire.</p> <p>Wilberforce was initially established as the African Methodist Episcopal Seminary of the West. It provided a liberal arts education to African American students and the first three African American students graduated in 1861. The school closed during the Civil War and reopened in 1863. After the war, the school was reorganized to become Wilberforce University and began to admit students from around the country.</p> <p>The schoolâ€™s curriculum was broadened and it was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1920. After World War II, the school experienced a period of growth and expansion, including the addition of several new academic buildings and the establishment of the first nursing program for African American students.</p> <p>In the 1960s, Wilberforce University was at the center of the civil rights movement and many of its students were involved in the fight for equality. In the 1970s and 1980s, the school struggled financially, leading to its closure in 1988.</p> <p>However, in 1991, the school was re-incorporated and re-opened as Wilberforce University. The school has since seen a resurgence, with new programs and initiatives to attract students and increase enrollment. Today, Wilberforce University is a vibrant institution with a strong commitment to its mission of providing a quality education to diverse students.</p>"
