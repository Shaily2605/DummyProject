            data: "<p><b>Newman College</b> is a constituent college of the University of Dublin, located in the city of Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1854 by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, John Henry Newman, and is one of the oldest Catholic universities in Ireland.</p> <p>Newman College was established as the Catholic University of Ireland, the first Catholic university in Ireland since the Reformation, and was intended to provide Catholic students with an education equal to that of the Protestant-run colleges of the University of Dublin. Newman College was the first university in Ireland to admit students of any religion, and was the only Catholic university in Ireland until the establishment of the University College Cork in 1875.</p> <p>The college moved to its current location in St Stephen's Green in 1858, and was granted a royal charter in 1859, becoming a constituent college of the University of Dublin. The college has since grown to become one of the most prestigious universities in Ireland and the UK, and is renowned for its academic excellence and strong Catholic ethos.</p>"
