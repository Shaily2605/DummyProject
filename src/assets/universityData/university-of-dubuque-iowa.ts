            data: "<p>The <b>University of Dubuque</b> was founded in 1852 by a group of German Evangelical Synod of North America pastors and laymen. The university was originally called the German Theological School of the Northwest and was located in the small Iowa community of Dubuque. In 1869, the school was renamed Dubuque College, and in 1909, it was renamed the University of Dubuque. The University of Dubuque moved to its current location on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River in 1952. In the late 20th century, the school was transformed from a small liberal arts college to a comprehensive university offering a variety of degree programs. Today, the University of Dubuque is a private, liberal arts university with an enrollment of more than 1,500 students. The university offers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in fields such as business, education, engineering, and nursing.</p>"
