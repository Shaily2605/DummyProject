            data: "<p><b>The American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA)</b> is one of the oldest acting schools in the United States. Founded in 1884 by David Belasco and Henry Millar, the school has trained thousands of actors, including many who have gone on to become some of the most recognizable names in the entertainment industry.</p> <p>The Academy opened its doors in 1884 with a mission to provide aspiring actors with the highest quality of professional training. In its early years, the Academy offered classes in acting, elocution, and stagecraft, and its students performed in several productions at the Union Square Theatre. Over the years, the curriculum has expanded to include courses in playwriting, improvisation, on-camera acting, and other areas.</p> <p>The Academy is a member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre and is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. It has campuses in both New York and Los Angeles, and is one of the few schools to offer a two-year conservatory program.
