The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Lewes, and Georgetown. UD is a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant university, with an approximate enrollment of 23,000 students.</p> <p>The history of the University of Delaware began in 1743, when the Rev. Dr. Francis Alison founded a Free School in New London, Pennsylvania. The school opened in 1745, and in 1765, it was chartered as the Academy of Newark and subsequently renamed the Newark Academy. In 1833, the Academy was merged with the adjacent Newark College to form the College of Newark, which later became the University of Delaware.</p> <p>In 1921, the University of Delaware became a land-grant college, and in 1945, it received its first major federal research grant, for the development of a radar system. In the 1950s, the University joined the space-grant program, and in the 1960s, it became a sea-grant college.</p> <p>Today, the University of Delaware is one of the top public research universities in the nation, and its programs are consistently ranked among the best in the country. It offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide variety of disciplines.</p>"
