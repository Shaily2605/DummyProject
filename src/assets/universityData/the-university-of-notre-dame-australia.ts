            data: "<p><b>The University of Notre Dame Australia</b>, Western Australia, Australia was founded in 1989 as the first university in Australia to be established by a religious order. It was established by the Sisters of Notre Dame who are a part of the Catholic Church. The university initially offered only a few undergraduate degrees and was a small educational institution.</p> <p>In 1990, Notre Dame opened the Broome and Fremantle campuses. This expansion enabled the university to offer a wider range of courses, including postgraduate and research degrees.</p> <p>In 1997, the university received its first round of government funding which enabled it to expand further and offer courses in areas such as law, nursing, business, and education.</p> <p>In 2002, the university opened its third campus in Sydney, allowing it to offer courses in areas such as medicine, dentistry, and physiotherapy.</p> <p>Today, the university has five campuses located across Australia, offering a wide range of courses from undergraduate and postgraduate programs to research degrees. It has also established a number of partnerships with industry and government organisations, allowing students to gain valuable work experience.</p> <p>The university is committed to providing a quality education and promoting social justice, ethical behaviour, and responsible citizenship. It has a strong commitment to research and strives to be a leader in its field.</p>"
