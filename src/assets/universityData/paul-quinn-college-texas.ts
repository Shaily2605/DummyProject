            data: "<p><b>Paul Quinn College</b> is a private, historically black college in Dallas, Texas. Founded in 1872 by a group of African Methodist Episcopal Church leaders, the college was originally known as Quinn Chapel Academy. The school was renamed Paul Quinn College after a prominent African-American pastor, Paul Quinn, in 1890.</p> <p>Initially, the school was established to provide religious and basic education to newly freed slaves in Texas. In the early years, the college provided only elementary and secondary education, with a focus on religious studies, until 1912 when it began offering a two-year college program. In 1926, the school was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, allowing it to award associate degrees.</p> <p>In the mid-1930s, the college began expanding its curriculum to offer a four-year program, and in 1941 it was accredited to offer bachelor's degrees. In the 1950s, Paul Quinn College experienced a period of growth, with the construction of new buildings. In the 1960s, the school experienced a period of decline as the civil rights movement led to a decrease in enrollment.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, the school was nearly closed due to financial difficulties, but it was saved by a group of alumni who formed the Paul Quinn Educational and Charitable Foundation. This group worked to raise money and increase enrollment, leading to the school's successful reaccreditation in the 1980s.</p> <p>Today, Paul Quinn College is a four-year, private, historically black college that offers 25 degree programs in the fields of business, education, and the liberal arts. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and it is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.</p>"
