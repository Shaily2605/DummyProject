The original purpose of the school was to provide theological education for the Lutheran Church. In 1924, the seminary was renamed Waterloo College and began offering a liberal arts program in addition to its theological program. In 1960, the college became Waterloo Lutheran University and then, in 1973, it was changed to Wilfrid Laurier University, in honour of the seventh Prime Minister of Canada. Since then, the University has grown to become one of the most respected schools in Canada, with a strong focus on research, teaching and learning. Wilfrid Laurier University now offers more than 90 undergraduate and over 50 graduate programs, in areas such as business, arts, sciences, music, education and theology.</p>"
