            data: "<p><b>Occidental College</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Los Angeles, California. Founded in 1887, Occidental College is the oldest liberal arts college in Southern California. The college was originally founded by a group of Presbyterian clergy and laymen, led by James George Bell, as 'a college of the first class, entirely under the control and patronage of the Church.' The college was originally named 'Tigers', but was later changed to Occidental College in honor of the college's founders.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, the college began to expand its academic offerings, adding a law school in 1908 and a medical school in 1912. The 1920s and 30s saw the college's enrollment swell, and the campus expanded to include new buildings, including a library and student union.</p> <p>During World War II, Occidental College was home to the United States Army Air Corps' Advanced Flying School. Following the war, the college experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion, including the construction of a new library, student union, and several other buildings. In the 1970s, the college began to focus more on its commitment to a liberal arts education, and began to attract more students from diverse backgrounds.</p> <p>Today, Occidental College is a small liberal arts college with a strong commitment to undergraduate education, offering more than 40 majors and minors. The college is known for its small class sizes, and for its commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion.</p>"
