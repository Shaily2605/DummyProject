Founded in 1451, the university is located in Glasgow, Scotland. The university is the second-oldest university in Scotland and was founded by a charter granted by Pope Nicholas V in 1451. Glasgow was a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment and it is the birthplace of Adam Smith, the father of modern economics.</p> <p>The University of Glasgow was originally a religious foundation but by the nineteenth century it had become a secular institution. Over the centuries, the university has produced a number of world-renowned scientists, philosophers, writers and politicians, including Thomas Campbell, Lord Kelvin, Peter Higgs and many more.</p> <p>In the twentieth century the university began to expand its research output and since then has grown to be one of the leading research universities in Europe. Today the university has around 25,000 students and is home to seven Nobel Prize winners. In addition, it is a member of the Russell Group of leading UK universities.</p>"
