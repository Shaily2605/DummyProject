The university offers over 200 undergraduate and graduate programs in nine schools and colleges.</p> <p>Northeastern was founded in 1898 as the Evening Institute for Younger Men at the Huntington Avenue YMCA in Boston. In its early years, the school offered secretarial and vocational classes to help working-class adults gain job skills and gain a foothold in the middle class. In 1935, the institute was renamed Northeastern University and began offering both day and night classes. During this time, the school began to focus on science and engineering education and became a leader in co-op education, allowing students to alternate semesters of study with periods of paid work.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Northeastern began to expand its academic offerings, adding new degree programs and establishing new schools. In 1964, the University established a College of Liberal Arts, followed by a College of Education in 1966. The school continued to grow in the 1970s, adding a College of Computer Science, an Honors Program, and a School of Nursing. In 1982, Northeastern opened a College of Business Administration, which became the D'Amore-McKim School of Business in 1996.</p> <p>Today, Northeastern University is a leader in research and experiential learning. The University has a total enrollment of more than 20,000 students, and its nine schools offer more than 200 degree programs. The University is also known for its innovative co-op program, which allows students to gain real-world experience through paid work placements with partner employers.</p>"
