            data: "<p><b>Pomona College</b> is a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. It was founded in 1887 by a group of Congregationalists who wanted to create a college in the mold of small New England institutions. The school opened its doors in October 1888 with just over 100 students and seven faculty members. In the years since, Pomona has grown to become one of the most selective and prestigious liberal arts colleges in the United States. The college has consistently been ranked among the top liberal arts colleges in the country by U.S. News & World Report.</p> <p>The college is known for its commitment to interdisciplinary learning, and its students have the opportunity to pursue a wide range of academic disciplines, from the traditional sciences and humanities, to the social sciences, to the performing arts. Additionally, the college has a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, and is one of only a handful of colleges in the country to receive a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Campus Climate Index.</p> <p>Pomona has a long and storied history of producing notable alumni, including two Nobel Prize-winners, seven Pulitzer Prize-winners, two Supreme Court justices, and a host of business leaders, scientists, writers, and politicians.</p>"
