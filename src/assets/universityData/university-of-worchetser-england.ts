            data: "<p>The <b>University of Worcester</b> is a public research university located in Worcester, England. It received university status in 2005, although its origins date back to the late 19th century.</p> <p>The origins of the university can be traced back to the formation of the Worcester Diocesan Training School in 1862. This was a Church of England-run school that provided training for teachers and was located at the former premises of the National School in Foregate Street. It was renamed the Worcester and Hereford Diocesan Training College in 1924, and in 1975 it became the Worcester College of Education.</p> <p>The college was awarded degree-awarding powers in 1997, and in 1998 it was granted full university status and renamed the University of Worcester. The university has since expanded its offering with the addition of the Worcester Business School in 2004 and the Institute of Health and Society in 2008. It now offers a wide range of academic courses in areas such as business, law, health, education, and psychology.</p>"
