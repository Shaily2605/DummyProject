            data: "<p><b>Rockford University</b>, located in Rockford, Illinois, was founded in 1847 as Rockford Female Seminary. The college was founded by a group of civic leaders and ministers who wanted to provide a college education for young women in the midwestern region of the United States. The seminary was chartered in 1852, and in 1892, it was renamed Rockford College. The college was co-educational from its opening in 1847, though the enrollment of male students was limited for many years.</p> <p>In the late 1950s, the college began to receive more recognition, and the number of students began to grow. In 1967, the college was granted university status, and the name was changed to Rockford University. Over the next few decades, the university experienced steady growth, and in 1995, the university opened its first graduate program, a master's degree in management.</p> <p>Today, Rockford University has an enrollment of nearly 1,500 students and offers undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education programs. The university has also expanded its campus significantly, adding a number of new buildings and facilities. The university is home to a number of notable alumni, including former Illinois Governor Henry Horner, who served from 1933 to 1940.</p>"
