            data: "<p><b>Texas Wesleyan University (TWC)</b> is a private, coeducational university in Fort Worth, Texas. Founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in 1890, the university is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Texas Wesleyan University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award baccalaureate, master’s, and doctoral degrees.</p> <p>The university began as Polytechnic College in 1890, with five faculty members and 103 students. Initially, the main campus was located in a building on Weatherford Street in downtown Fort Worth. In 1902, the school was renamed Texas Wesleyan College as a memorial to the founders of the Methodist Church in Texas, Thomas Wesley and Emory S. Foster. In 1914, the college moved to its current location, a 40-acre (160,000 m2) campus on the banks of the Trinity River.</p> <p>In 1945, the college was renamed Texas Wesleyan University and began offering graduate programs. In the 1970s and 1980s, the university established several new academic programs, including a School of Education, a School of Business Administration, and a School of Nursing. In 1984, the university opened the doors of its new School of Law.</p> <p>In recent years, Texas Wesleyan has expanded its academic offerings and built new facilities. In 2002, the university opened a new library and renovated its traditional chapel. The university has also made investments in new student housing, technology, and athletics. In 2015, the university opened its new School of Business, and in 2017, the university opened its new Athletic & Aquatic Center. Today, Texas Wesleyan University serves over 3,000 students.</p>"
