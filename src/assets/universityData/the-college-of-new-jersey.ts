            data: "<p><b>The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)</b> was founded in 1855 as the New Jersey State Normal School. It was the first normal school in the state of New Jersey and the fifth in the United States. It was established in response to the growing need for a trained teaching workforce in the newly industrialized state. The original charter specified that the school would provide instruction in the “art of teaching” and the “various branches of learning” in order to “promote the intellectual, moral, and industrial improvement of the youth of New Jersey.”</p> <p>In 1938, the school was re-named the New Jersey State Teachers College at Trenton, and its curriculum began to expand to include areas other than education. In 1956, the name was changed again to the New Jersey College for Women. In 1959, the school merged with the former Trenton State College (established in 1929) and was renamed the College of New Jersey.</p> <p>Today, TCNJ is a public liberal arts college with a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs in the arts and sciences. It is ranked among the top public universities in the country and is recognized for its commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and service.</p>"
