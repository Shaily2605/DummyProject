            data: "<p><b>Stephens College</b> is a women's college located in Columbia, Missouri. Founded in 1833, it is the second-oldest female educational establishment that is still a women's college in the United States. It was founded as the Columbia Female Academy by the Methodist Church and was renamed Stephens College after James L. Stephens, who was its first president. It was one of the earliest institutions of higher learning for women. The college was initially located in a building downtown, but it moved to its current location in 1872.</p> <p>Throughout its history, Stephens College has been a leader in providing educational opportunities for women. During the Civil War, the school was forced to close, but it reopened in 1865 and began offering degrees in 1866. In 1873, it became the first college to grant academic degrees to women and has continued to do so ever since. In addition to academic programs, the college offers a variety of extracurricular activities, including theatre, music, dance, and art. It also has an athletic program that includes basketball, volleyball, and tennis.</p> <p>Today, Stephens College is a private, independent liberal arts college with a focus on leadership, service, and the professional development of women. It offers more than 40 undergraduate degree programs and several graduate programs. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>"
