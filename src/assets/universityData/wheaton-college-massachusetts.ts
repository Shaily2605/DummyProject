It became coeducational in 1988.</p> <p>In 1834, Wheaton Female Seminary was established with a charter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The seminary was founded by Eliza Wheaton with the help of her husband, Joseph Wheaton, and the support of a group of Congregationalist ministers from the Massachusetts area. Eliza Wheaton had been a teacher at the Waterford Academy in Maine, and had been a proponent of education for women. Her husband, Joseph Wheaton, was a minister who believed strongly in the education of women.</p> <p>In 1835, the seminary opened its doors with an enrollment of 24 students. In 1838, the seminary received a collegiate charter and began offering college-level courses. In 1846, the seminary was renamed Wheaton Female College and became the first women's college in Massachusetts. The college began granting bachelor's degrees in 1850.</p> <p>In 1888, Wheaton Female College became coeducational and changed its name to Wheaton College. During the 20th century, the college had several name changes, including Wheaton College for Women (1924-1955), Wheaton College of Massachusetts (1955-1988), and Wheaton College (1988-present).</p> <p>Today, Wheaton College is a residential liberal arts college with over 2000 students.
