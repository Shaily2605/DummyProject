It is the largest university in Alberta and was established in 1966.</p> <p>The roots of the University of Calgary can be traced back to the creation of the Normal School in Calgary in 1905. This school was created to train teachers for the growing population of the province of Alberta. The school became part of the University of Alberta in 1911 and eventually, the Alberta Normal School was relocated to the University of Alberta's Calgary campus in 1945.</p> <p>In 1960, the Alberta government established the Calgary branch of the University of Alberta which was then known as the University of Alberta, Calgary. This branch was responsible for the creation of the University of Calgary, which was officially established in 1966 as a separate university.</p> <p>Since then, the University of Calgary has rapidly grown and now has over 30,000 students, making it the second largest university in Canada. The University of Calgary continues to be a leader in research, education and innovation.</p>"
