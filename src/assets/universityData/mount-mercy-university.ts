            data: "<p><b>Mount Mercy University</b> was founded in 1928 by the Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters of Mercy had come to Cedar Rapids from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1873 to serve the needs of the Cedar Rapids community. The Sisters of Mercy built and opened the motherhouse and academy for young women in 1875. It was the first educational institution in Cedar Rapids.</p> <p>In 1928, the Sisters of Mercy established Mount Mercy Junior College, the first Catholic college in Iowa, which offered two-year college degrees to women. The college was later renamed Mount Mercy College, and it began to offer four-year degrees in 1934. In 1957, the college became co-educational and began to offer graduate degree programs in 1969.</p> <p>In 1998, the college was renamed Mount Mercy University, reflecting its growth and expansion over the years. Since then, the university has added several new academic programs and has opened new centers and institutes. In 2013, the university opened its Center for Professional Excellence, which provides educational and career services to students, alumni and the community.</p>"
