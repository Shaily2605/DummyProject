The campus is a comprehensive research university, offering over 100 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Rutgers–Newark is one of the oldest universities in the United States, having been founded in 1766 as the Newark Academy. In 1808, the school was reorganized as the College of New Jersey, a private college affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church.

The campus has also been home to the first African-American student at Rutgers and the first African-American professor at Rutgers, as well as the first Hispanic student at Rutgers and the first female student at Rutgers.</p> <p>Rutgers–Newark has made great strides in recent years in its efforts to become a more diverse and welcoming campus.
