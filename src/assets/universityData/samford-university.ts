Samford enrolls 5,467 students from 45 states and 30 countries in its 10 academic schools: arts, arts and sciences, business, divinity, education, health professions, law, nursing, pharmacy, and public health.</p> <p>Samford University was founded in 1841 as Howard College by the Alabama Baptist Convention. It was named after John Howard, a British religious leader who served as a chaplain in the American Revolutionary War and later as a minister in England. The school was established with the intention of being a liberal arts college dedicated to the Baptist faith.</p> <p>In 1868, the school was moved to East Lake, a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, and renamed East Lake University. In 1887, the college was renamed again to Samford University in honor of Frank Samford, a prominent Alabama Baptist. The school's library opened in 1888 and was named in honor of William H. Mason, a former president of the school.</p> <p>In 1942, the school moved to its current location in Homewood, Alabama, and began offering graduate programs. In 1959, the name of the school was changed to Samford University. Today, the university offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degrees in business, education, the humanities, and the sciences.</p>"
