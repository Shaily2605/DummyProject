            data: "<p><b>St. Joseph’s University</b> is a private, Jesuit university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, the university has a long and distinguished history. St. Joseph’s was the first Catholic university in Pennsylvania and the first Catholic university to award degrees to women.</p> <p>The university grew out of St. Joseph’s College, which was founded in 1851 and located on the grounds of the now-defunct St. Joseph’s Church. The college was initially a two-year institution that provided a classical education to young men. In 1868, the college was elevated to university status and began offering four-year degrees in liberal arts and sciences.</p> <p>In 1912, the university began admitting women into its ranks, making it the first Catholic university in the nation to do so. In 1927, the university moved to its current location on City Avenue in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia, and in the following decades expanded its academic offerings to include professional degrees in business, nursing, and other fields.</p> <p>Today, St. Joseph’s is a thriving university with more than 8,000 students. It offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degrees in more than 80 fields of study. The university is also known for its commitment to service and social justice, and has a long history of working to improve the quality of life in the surrounding community.</p>"
