It was founded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1906, though its roots reach back a quarter-century earlier. In the fall 2020 semester, enrollment was approximately 20,000. The subject of heavy construction since the late 1990s, the main campus sits atop a hill with a commanding view of the Barren River valley.</p> <p>WKU's athletic teams, the Hilltoppers, compete in Conference USA. The men's soccer team won the Sun Belt Conference Tournament in 2008 and Conference USA regular season and tournament championships in 2018. The football team has made 12 straight bowl game appearances (2008–2019). The university's forerunner, the Southern Normal School and Business College, was founded in 1875 as a private college to train teachers. In 1906, after the school changed its name to the Western Kentucky State Normal School, it was chartered as a public institution. The school became a four-year college in 1909 and a university in 1966.</p> <p>WKU has satellite campuses in Glasgow, Elizabethtown-Fort Knox and Owensboro. The main campus in Bowling Green is composed of academic and residential buildings, including 7 residence halls, the Augenstein Alumni Center, the Gary A. Ransdell Hall and the Kentucky Building, which houses the Kentucky Museum and the Kentucky Library.</p>"
