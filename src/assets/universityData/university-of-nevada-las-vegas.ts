In 1973, the Thomas and Mack Center was opened, followed by the Las Vegas Convention Center in 1975. The university also opened the UNLV Performing Arts Center in 1976.</p> <p>Since then, the university has continued to grow, including the establishment of the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration in 1982 and the expansion of the medical school in 2014.</p> <p>Today, UNLV is a comprehensive research university with more than 29,000 students, offering more than 200 majors, degrees, and certificates.
