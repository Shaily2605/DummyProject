Richard Hesson, who had a vision for a university that would provide quality education to students at all levels. The school was initially located in downtown Lima, Ohio, and offered courses in accounting, secretarial science, business administration and related topics.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the school moved to its current location on Lima’s north side and changed its name to the Northwestern Business College. During this period, the college began offering a two-year degree program in business administration.</p> <p>In the 1970s, the school was granted permission to offer four-year degree programs in business, accounting, and computer and information systems. In 1977, the school was renamed the University of Northwestern Ohio.</p> <p>Today, UNOH offers over 40 degree programs in a variety of disciplines including automotive, business, health and human services, engineering, technology and more. The school has also expanded its physical campus, which now spans over 200 acres, and established additional locations in Indiana and Kentucky.</p>"
