            data: "<p><b>Saint Vladimir's College</b>, located in Manitoba, Canada, was established in 1911 as the Ukrainian Orthodox Missionary and Education Society of Canada. It was the first Ukrainian Orthodox college in Canada, founded to serve the needs of the Ukrainian Orthodox immigrants who had recently arrived in Manitoba. The college was initially located in a small house on Portage Avenue in Winnipeg, but moved to its current location in the early 1920s. The college was renamed Saint Vladimir's College in 1927, and in 1933 it was granted a charter by the Province of Manitoba to award degrees.</p> <p>Throughout its history, Saint Vladimir's College has served as an important cultural and educational center for Ukrainian Canadians. It has offered a variety of programs, including theology, Ukrainian language and literature, history, and philosophy. It has also been a center for the study of Ukrainian culture and history, hosting lectures and seminars on topics related to Ukrainian culture and history. In addition to its academic programs, the college has also served as a spiritual center for the Ukrainian Orthodox community, providing religious services and hosting conferences and retreats.</p> <p>In recent years, Saint Vladimir's College has expanded its focus to include courses and programs that are more broadly related to Ukrainian studies. The college now offers courses in Ukrainian literature, history, and culture, as well as courses in Ukrainian language. It also offers a Master of Arts in Ukrainian Studies program, which is designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of Ukrainian language, culture, and history. The college is also home to a library, which contains a large collection of Ukrainian books, manuscripts, and other materials.</p>"
