            data: "<p><b>Texas Christian University</b> is a private, coeducational university located in Fort Worth, Texas. Founded in 1873, it is the oldest university in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. TCU is affiliated with, but not governed by, the Disciples of Christ. The university consists of 8 colleges and schools and has a total enrollment of over 10,000 students.</p> <p>TCU was founded in 1873 by Addison and Randolph Clark, brothers and former members of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The brothers purchased land in Fort Worth and established the school as AddRan Male and Female College. The school opened its doors in 1873 with a faculty of five and an enrollment of around 100 students. During the early years, the school was plagued by financial difficulties, and in 1889, the school was sold to brothers Abner and James S. Clark, who renamed the school Texas Christian University.</p> <p>During the 20th century, TCU underwent a period of growth and expansion. The university added a law school in the 1920s, and in the 1940s, the school became a member of the Southwest Conference. In the 1950s, the school began to expand its athletic programs, and in the 1960s, TCU began to offer a wide range of degree programs, from the traditional liberal arts to more professional-focused degrees.</p> <p>Today, TCU is a comprehensive university with more than 150 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The university has a total enrollment of over 10,000 students and is home to 8 colleges and schools, including the College of Science and Engineering, the Neeley School of Business, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Communication, the College of Education, and the Honors College. TCU is also home to the TCU Institute of Child Development, the TCU Energy Institute, and the TCU Institute for Environmental Studies.</p>"
