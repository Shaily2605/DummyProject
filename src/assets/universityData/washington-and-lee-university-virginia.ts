            data: "<p><b>Washington and Lee University</b> is a private liberal arts college in Lexington, Virginia, founded in 1749 as Augusta Academy. The university is named for two of its most prominent historical figures, General George Washington and Robert E. Lee.</p> <p>Washington and Lee traces its roots to the 1730s, when Augusta Academy was established in the Shenandoah Valley. Founded by Scots-Irish Presbyterians, the school offered education to local children and young men. In 1749, Augusta Academy was designated a college, and the name was changed to Liberty Hall Academy.</p> <p>During the American Revolution, Liberty Hall Academy served as a military hospital and barracks. In 1796, the school was chartered as Washington College in honor of George Washington, who had provided the school with a $20,000 endowment. In 1813, Washington College began admitting women, making it one of the first colleges to do so.</p> <p>In 1865, General Robert E. Lee was appointed president of Washington College. He served in that role until his death in 1870. After his death, the school was renamed Washington and Lee University in his honor.</p> <p>Since then, the university has grown and flourished. Today, Washington and Lee is a highly selective, nationally-ranked university with a strong tradition of excellence in education.</p>"
