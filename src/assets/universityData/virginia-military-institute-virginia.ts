            data: "<p>The <b>Virginia Military Institute (VMI)</b> is a public Military college located in Lexington, Virginia. Founded in 1839, it is the oldest Military college in the United States. VMI is the only Military college in the country that still relies on the “corps” system of student governance, which consists of a highly regimented lifestyle with strict rules, uniforms, and a military rank structure.</p> <p>VMI was founded in 1839 as the Virginia Military Institute. It was established in response to the need for more advanced military training for the Virginia militia, which was then in the midst of a dispute with the federal government over the right to arm themselves. The institute was modeled after the United States Military Academy at West Point, and its first class began with 45 cadets.</p> <p>During the Civil War, VMI sent more than 1,000 alumni to fight for the Confederacy, many of whom held high ranks in the Army of Northern Virginia. After the war, the institute was forced to close its doors, but it reopened in 1868 and has been in operation ever since.</p> <p>In the years since its reopening, VMI has become a premier military college, with a rigorous academic curriculum and a strong focus on military training. The school is also renowned for its athletic programs, particularly its football team, which has been the top-ranked team in the Southern Conference since 1997.</p>"
