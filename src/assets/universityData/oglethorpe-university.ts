            data: "<p><b>Oglethorpe University</b>, founded in 1835, is a private liberal arts college in Brookhaven, Georgia. It is the oldest private college in Georgia and has a rich history and tradition.</p> <p>The university was founded by a group of prominent citizens and clergymen, led by Methodist minister and philanthropist James Edward Oglethorpe. They wanted to establish a school that would provide a quality education to young people regardless of their religious and economic backgrounds. In the early days of the university, students attended classes in a schoolhouse, while the rest of the campus was still under construction.</p> <p>In the late 1800s, the university began to expand and added several buildings, including an auditorium, a library, and a gymnasium. The university also introduced several new programs, including a law school, a pharmacy school, and a medical school.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, Oglethorpe University changed from a small community college to a larger, four-year university. The school also expanded its campus, adding several new buildings and dormitories.</p> <p>Throughout its history, Oglethorpe University has remained committed to its mission of providing quality education to all students, regardless of their backgrounds or financial means. It is now a highly respected liberal arts college and is ranked among the top universities in the United States.</p>"
