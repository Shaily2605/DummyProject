It is the state’s flagship institution and the only university in the state with a medical school. The school has a long history of research and innovation and has played an important role in the development of the state.</p> <p>UNR was originally located in Elko, Nevada, but moved to Reno in 1885 due to a lack of funding. The university continued to expand and by 1948 the school had grown to include seven colleges and schools. In 1969, the School of Medicine was established and the school was officially renamed the University of Nevada, Reno.</p> <p>In the 1990’s, UNR underwent a period of expansion, adding new buildings, programs, and research centers. The school also continued to grow its student population, with enrollment reaching a record 22,000 in 2010.</p> <p>Today, UNR continues to be a leader in research and innovation, with a focus on sustainability, entrepreneurship, and interdisciplinary studies. The school is also home to a number of nationally recognized programs and research centers, including the Nevada Seismological Laboratory, the Desert Research Institute, and the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.</p>"
