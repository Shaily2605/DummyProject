Founded in 1963, U de M is one of the three universities in the province, alongside University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University.</p> <p>The University of Moncton was established in 1963 as the Université de Moncton by the New Brunswick government. The university was created to meet the needs of the province's francophone population, as the English-speaking majority had access to post-secondary education at the University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University. It was first housed in the former Moncton High School building, and eventually moved to a new campus in 1968.</p> <p>The university quickly grew, and by the early 1970s, it was the largest French-language university in Canada. In 1975, the university launched its first graduate programs, and in 1979, the university opened its law school, the first in Atlantic Canada.</p> <p>In the years since then, the university has continued to grow, and now offers over 120 undergraduate and graduate programs. In addition, the university boasts multiple research centers, a thriving athletics program, and extensive cultural and social activities.</p>"
