It was the first normal school in New Jersey and was opened to train teachers for the growing public school system in the state. In 1916, the school was renamed the New Jersey State Normal School at Paterson in 1916. The school underwent several changes in its early years, becoming the Paterson State Teachers College in 1937 and then the Paterson State College in 1958.</p> <p>The school underwent a major transformation in 1971, when it was granted university status and took its current name, William Paterson University. The school changed its focus from solely teacher education to a broader curriculum, offering degree programs in a variety of fields. Since then, the university has continued to grow, expanding its academic offerings, introducing new facilities, and increasing its student population. Today, William Paterson University is a comprehensive public university offering more than 250 undergraduate and graduate degree programs.</p>"
