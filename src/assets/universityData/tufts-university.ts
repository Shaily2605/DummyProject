            data: "<p><b>Tufts University</b> is a private research university located in Medford and Somerville, Massachusetts. Founded in 1852, Tufts is organized into ten schools, including two undergraduate programs and eight graduate divisions, on four campuses in Massachusetts and the French Alps. The university emphasizes active citizenship and public service in all its disciplines and is known for its internationalism and study abroad programs.</p> <p>Tufts was founded in 1852 by Christian Universalists who sought to open a non-sectarian institution of higher learning. Charles Tufts donated the land for the campus on Walnut Hill, the highest point in Medford, saying that he wanted to set a 'light on the hill.' The name was subsequently changed to Tufts University. For more than a century, Tufts was a small New England liberal arts college. The university's original curriculum focused on classical studies, and the university's size and resources have grown steadily. By 1975, Tufts had grown to include ten schools, known as the 'Tufts 10' and by 2020, Tufts had grown to include schools and programs across the world. Today, Tufts is home to a vibrant academic community with a strong focus on interdisciplinary research and experiential learning.</p>"
