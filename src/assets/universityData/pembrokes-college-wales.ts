            data: "<p><b>Pembroke College</b>, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, is located in the historic city of Oxford, England. Founded in 1624, it is the third oldest college in the university after University College and Balliol College. The college is named after William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who founded it and also served as its first chancellor. The college is renowned for its beautiful architecture and its impressive collection of manuscripts and books.</p> <p>The college's first president, Dr Thomas Allen, was an ordained priest who had studied at Cambridge. He was an avid supporter of the university's mission to promote learning and knowledge. Under his guidance and leadership, the college grew in size and stature. The college was soon granted a royal charter and began to attract a number of prominent scholars, including the philosopher John Locke, who lectured there.</p> <p>In the 18th century, the college was home to a number of prominent figures, including the poet Alexander Pope, who lived there for a period of time. The college also maintained close ties with the royal family, with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, both having matriculated there.</p> <p>Pembroke College is still a prominent college within the University of Oxford and has a rich history and culture. Today, it continues to be a vibrant centre of learning and academic excellence.</p>"
