            data: "<p>The <b>University of San Francisco (USF)</b> was founded in 1855 as the first university in San Francisco as the result of a merger between two existing schools: St. Ignatius Academy and the College of the Sacred Heart. St. Ignatius Academy, founded in 1855 by the Jesuits, was the first male educational institution in the city; the College of the Sacred Heart, founded in 1851 by the Sisters of Mercy, was the first womenâ€™s school.</p> <p>In 1868, USF moved to its current location on the corner of Van Ness Avenue and Hayes Street. The university was originally located where the current St. Ignatius Church stands. In 1880, USF became the first university in California to admit women. In 1925, a new campus was built on what is now known as Lone Mountain.</p> <p>The university experienced tremendous growth throughout the 20th century, with more than 10,000 students enrolled by 1965. In 1978, USF became the first Jesuit university in the country to establish a College of Ethnic Studies. In 1990, the university opened a satellite campus in Pleasanton, California. In the 2000s, USF opened a new campus in Downtown San Francisco and began offering online degree programs.</p> <p>Today, USF is a thriving university with more than 11,000 students enrolled in more than 80 majors, minors, and concentrations. The university is also home to numerous research centers, including the Center for the Pacific Rim, the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good, and the Institute for Nonprofit Management and Leadership. USF continues to be a leader in higher education and is committed to making an impact in its local and global communities.</p>"
