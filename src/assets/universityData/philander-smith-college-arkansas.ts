            data: "<p><b>Philander Smith College</b> is a historically black college in Little Rock, Arkansas. Founded in 1877 by the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, it was the first four-year college in the state designed to educate African Americans. The college was named after AME Bishop Philander Smith, who was a strong advocate for African American education.</p> <p>The college's first president was Richard Theodore Van Horn, who had been appointed by the church to serve in that role. He was succeeded by William H. Smith, who was the college's president for nearly 30 years. Smith oversaw a period of tremendous growth at the college, including the construction of new buildings and the establishment of a number of educational programs.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, the college's curriculum was expanded to include courses in the liberal arts, sciences, and engineering. Philander Smith College also began to offer graduate-level courses and in 1925, it became the first African American college to offer a Master of Science degree.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the college's enrollment increased significantly and it moved to a new location on West 12th Street. The college continued to expand its offerings and in the 1950s, it began to offer courses in business and education.</p> <p>The college experienced a period of decline in the 1970s and 1980s due to financial difficulties, but it was able to recover in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2009, Philander Smith College partnered with the Clinton Foundation to create the Clinton Presidential Center, which is located on the college's campus. The center offers educational programs and activities for students, faculty, and the community.</p>"
