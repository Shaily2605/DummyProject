            data: "<p><b>St. Dunstan’s University (SDU)</b> was an Anglican university located in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, that operated between 1855 and 1969. The university was established by the Diocese of Charlottetown and began as a small college offering an arts program. Over the years, as the school grew, so did its academic offerings, and SDU eventually became a degree-granting university.</p> <p>Throughout its history, SDU was affiliated with the Anglican Church and was known for having a strong religious focus. The university was also the first in Canada to be led by a female president, Dr. Margaret C.P. Murray, who served from 1948 to 1959.</p> <p>In 1969, SDU closed its doors due to financial difficulties and declining enrollment. The university was amalgamated with the University of Prince Edward Island, and many of its buildings and campus grounds now form part of the University of Prince Edward Island's main campus.</p>"
