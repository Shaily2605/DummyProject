            data: "<p><b>Shepherd University</b> was founded in 1871 as Shepherd College by the West Virginia legislature. It was the state's first public institution of higher education. The college was named after Thomas Shepherd, a prominent local businessman and politician who donated the money to build the college's first building.</p> <p>The original mission of the college was to provide a liberal arts education to students in the region. In 1930, the college was renamed Shepherd College, and in 2004 it was renamed Shepherd University.</p> <p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shepherd College became one of the first colleges in the United States to offer an alternative education program. This program allowed students to pursue their own educational interests, outside of the traditional classroom setting.</p> <p>Today, Shepherd University is a comprehensive university offering more than 70 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It has grown from a small liberal arts college to a university with an enrollment of more than 4,000 students. The university is known for its strong academic programs, vibrant campus life, and commitment to public service.</p>"
