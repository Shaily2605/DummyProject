            data: "<p><b>The Glasgow School of Art (GSA)</b> is a higher education art school based in Glasgow, Scotland. It was founded in 1845 as the Glasgow Government School of Design and was initially located at 12 Ingram Street. The school was later renamed the Glasgow School of Art and Science in 1853, and became the first government-funded school of design in the UK. The school was relocated to its current location in the Scottish city of Glasgow in 1869, and has since expanded to occupy multiple buildings in the city centre.</p> <p>Throughout its history, the school has been associated with some of the most influential art movements of the 20th century, including the Glasgow Style (also known as the 'Glasgow Four'), Art Nouveau, and the Glasgow Group (which included Charles Rennie Mackintosh). In addition, the school has produced a number of renowned alumni, including artist and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, architect and designer Thomas Howarth, and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi.</p> <p>The school is known for its commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and practice. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in fine art, design, and architecture, as well as a range of short courses and professional development opportunities. It is also home to the Mackintosh School of Architecture, which was founded in 1895 and is one of the oldest architecture schools in the UK.</p>"
