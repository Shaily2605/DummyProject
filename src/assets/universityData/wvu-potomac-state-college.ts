In 1931, the college was placed under the jurisdiction of the West Virginia University (WVU) Board of Governors.</p> <p>In 1947, the college received its current name, Potomac State College of West Virginia University, and began to offer two-year associate degrees. In 1955, the college was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1962, the college's first four-year baccalaureate degrees were granted.</p> <p>From the 1960s to the present, Potomac State College has continued to grow and evolve to meet the changing educational needs of the region.
