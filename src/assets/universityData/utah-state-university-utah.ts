            data: "<p><b>Utah State University</b> is a public land-grant research university in Logan, Utah. It is the state's flagship university and offers more than 150 undergraduate and more than 90 graduate degree programs. Founded in 1888 as Utah's agricultural college, USU focused on agriculture, domestic arts, and mechanical arts. It has since expanded its academic programs to include liberal arts, business, economics, natural resource sciences, as well as engineering, technology and health sciences.</p> <p>In the mid-1800s, the Morrill Land-Grant Act was passed, which allowed the U.S. government to donate land to states for the purpose of building land-grant colleges. In 1888, the Utah Legislature passed the Utah Agricultural College Act, which provided for the establishment of the Utah Agricultural College (UAC) in Logan.</p> <p>The college opened in 1889 with seven instructors and 106 students. The first president of the college was Joseph M. Tanner, who served until 1892. During his tenure, the college was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and increased its course offerings and faculty.</p> <p>In 1903, the college was renamed Utah State University, and in 1913, it opened its first graduate school. USU has since grown to become the largest university in the state of Utah, with an enrollment of more than 28,000 students. The university continues to expand its research and academic programs, with a focus on sustainability and global engagement.</p>"
