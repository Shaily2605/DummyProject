            data: "<p><b>The Juilliard School</b> is a world-renowned performing arts conservatory located in New York City. Founded in 1905 by American financier and philanthropist Augustus D. Juilliard, it is one of the world's leading institutions for the performing arts, offering undergraduate and graduate programs in dance, drama, and music. Juilliard is one of the few institutions in the world that offers training in all three fields simultaneously.</p> <p>The Juilliard School began as the Institute of Musical Art, established in 1905 by Juilliard and his associates. The institute was designed to provide a comprehensive program of conservatory-level training in music. It initially offered a two-year program of study, and by the 1920s, it had become one of the most prestigious music schools in the country.</p> <p>In 1926, Juilliard and his associates began to expand the school's scope beyond music, and in 1928, the Institute of Musical Art merged with the newly established Juilliard Graduate School of Music and the Juilliard Drama School. The Juilliard School was then established, and it quickly became a leader in the performing arts.</p> <p>Over the years, the Juilliard School has produced many notable alumni, including violinist Itzhak Perlman, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John Adams. Today, the Juilliard School continues to be recognized as one of the premier institutions for the performing arts in the world.</p>"
