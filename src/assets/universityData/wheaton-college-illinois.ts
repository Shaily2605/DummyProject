            data: "<p><b>Wheaton College</b> is a private, evangelical liberal arts college located in Wheaton, Illinois. Founded in 1860, Wheaton is the oldest continuously-operating institution of higher learning in Illinois.</p> <p>Wheaton was founded as a coeducational institution by Jonathan Blanchard, a Congregationalist minister, abolitionist, and Temperance movement leader. Blanchard named the school after the Massachusetts town of Wheaton, where he had earned a degree at the Wheaton Theological Seminary. At the time, Wheaton was the only school in Illinois with a collegiate-level program for women.</p> <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Wheaton was a center of social activism, hosting women's suffrage rallies and student protests against the Vietnam War. In recent years, Wheaton has become known for its commitment to Christian values, and its student body is one of the most religiously diverse in the United States.</p> <p>Today, Wheaton College is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities and offers over 40 undergraduate majors and more than 20 graduate programs. The college is also home to over 2,400 students from over 70 countries.</p>"
