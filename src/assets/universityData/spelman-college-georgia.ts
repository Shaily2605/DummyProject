            data: "<p><b>Spelman College</b> is a historically black college located in Atlanta, Georgia. Founded in 1881, it is the oldest historically black college for women in the United States and the oldest institution of higher education for African-American women. The school was founded as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary by two white Baptist ministers, Rev. Edmund Asa Ware and Rev. Joseph T. Robert. The school was originally established to provide education for African-American women, and it was named after the Reverend Lucius L. Spelman, a prominent abolitionist from New England.</p> <p>In 1924, the college was granted a charter and the name was changed to Spelman College. During the civil rights movement, Spelman students were active in the struggle for racial justice, participating in marches and other demonstrations. In the late 1960s, the college was at the forefront of the effort to desegregate Georgia’s public schools. In recent years, Spelman has become well-known for its academic excellence and its focus on developing leaders among African-American women. Today, Spelman offers a wide range of degree programs, including a range of liberal arts and sciences, business, computer science, and engineering majors. The college also offers a variety of special programs, such as an honors program and a leadership program. Spelman is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.</p>"
