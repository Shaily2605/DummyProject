            data: "<p>The <b>University of Washington Bothell</b>, located in Bothell, Washington, is a public university and one of the three campuses of the University of Washington. Founded in 1990, UW Bothell is the newest of the three campuses and offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates.</p> <p>The founding of the University of Washington Bothell was part of a larger plan to expand the University of Washington's presence in the Puget Sound region. The idea for the campus was proposed in 1986 by Governor Booth Gardner, who wanted to expand access to higher education in the region. In 1989, the Washington State Legislature passed a bill that authorized the creation of the Bothell campus.</p> <p>The first classes at the campus were held in fall of 1990, with an enrollment of about 1,000 students. Since then, the university has seen tremendous growth. In 2017, UW Bothell enrolled a record 5,096 students and offered more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs. The campus has also become a leader in sustainability, being the first university in the state to achieve LEED Gold status for all of its buildings.</p>"
