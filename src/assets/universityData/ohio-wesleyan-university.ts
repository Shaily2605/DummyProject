            data: "<p><b>Ohio Wesleyan University</b> is a private liberal arts college founded in 1842 by Methodist leaders and scholars. Located in Delaware, Ohio, the university offers more than 90 majors, minors, and concentrations to its 2,100 undergraduate students and offers several graduate programs. Ohio Wesleyan is known for its diverse student body, international programs, and commitment to service.</p> <p>The college's history began in 1841, when Methodist Bishop Charles Elliott proposed a school in the newly founded city of Delaware, Ohio. The school was intended to provide a Christian education to young men in the area. The school opened in 1842, with eight students and two faculty members. Over the next several decades, the college flourished, growing to include more departments and courses, and expanding its student body.</p> <p>In 1873, the college became coeducational, and in 1889, it was renamed Ohio Wesleyan University. In the early 1900s, the university began to expand beyond its core liberal arts curriculum, adding more graduate programs and research opportunities. In the following decades, the university continued to expand and modernize, introducing new majors and specializations, such as the nation's first degree program in Environmental Studies. Ohio Wesleyan has also been recognized for its commitment to service, with many students taking part in volunteer activities and community service projects.</p> <p>Today, Ohio Wesleyan is a thriving institution, with a student body that is made up of students from all over the world. The university continues to provide a quality liberal arts education to its students, while also offering the opportunity for students to pursue their educational and career goals.</p>"
