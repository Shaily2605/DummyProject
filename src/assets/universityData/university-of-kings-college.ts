Founded in 1789 in Windsor, Nova Scotia, the university was originally established as King’s College by Royal Charter of King George III. The institution initially served as a preparatory school for students who wished to pursue higher education at British universities, but quickly evolved into a liberal arts college which included a full curriculum of courses in science, arts, and theology.</p> <p>In 1920, the university moved to Halifax and adopted the name, University of King’s College. In the 1940s, UKC began offering a Bachelor of Arts degree, and in the 1950s the first Master’s degree was granted. In the 1960s, the university expanded its liberal arts program to include a major in journalism, and in the 1970s it began offering a Bachelor of Science degree.</p> <p>Today, the University of King’s College is a small liberal arts institution which offers a range of undergraduate and graduate degrees in the humanities, science, and journalism. The university also has a thriving research community, with many faculty members conducting research in a wide range of disciplines.</p>"
