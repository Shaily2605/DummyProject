            data: "<p>The <b>University of Vermont</b> is the fifth oldest university in New England and the oldest university in the State of Vermont. It was established in 1791, making it the oldest public university in New England and the oldest university in the United States outside of the original 13 colonies. The University was founded as a private university in Burlington, Vermont and was chartered in 1791 as the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College.</p> <p>The University's first class of 1791 included just 11 students. Classes were initially held in the local Congregational Church until the first building on the campus was completed in 1802. In 1825, the University became the first American college to use the 'University' title, which was adopted by its legislature.</p> <p>The University's early history was marked by a number of controversies, including a period of financial difficulty in the 1830s. In 1834, the faculty voted to close the University due to a lack of funds, but the Vermont Legislature responded by providing funds to keep it open. In the mid-1800s, the University experienced a period of rapid growth, with the number of students increasing from 200 in 1856 to 1,200 in 1876.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, the University underwent a period of expansion and development, with the construction of new buildings and the introduction of new programs. In the 1940s, the University began to focus on research, and in the 1950s, it began to develop a reputation for its medical programs. Today, the University of Vermont is a comprehensive research university with a diverse student body of over 11,000 students. It offers over 100 undergraduate majors and over 70 graduate and professional degree programs.</p>"
