            data: "<p>The <b>Faculty of Law of the University</b> of New Brunswick in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was established in 1892 as the province's first law school. It was the first English-language common law school in Canada. The school was founded by the Law Society of New Brunswick, which appointed its first dean, the Honorable John A.G. MacKinnon, in 1893.</p> <p>The faculty initially shared the same building as UNB's Faculty of Arts and Science, and the first classes were held in the fall of 1893. By 1898, the faculty had grown to six faculty members and 28 students. In 1912, the faculty moved to its own building, known as the Law Building, which was located on the UNB campus.</p> <p>From its inception, the faculty has had a strong emphasis on legal scholarship and teaching, and has produced a number of leading scholars in the field. The faculty's first graduate was the Honorable John James Fraser, who went on to become the Chief Justice of New Brunswick. The faculty has maintained a commitment to providing students with a well-rounded legal education, and to supporting research and scholarship within the legal community.</p> <p>The faculty has undergone several expansions and renovations over the years, including the construction of the new Law Library building in 1972. The faculty currently offers a range of undergraduate and graduate programs, and has an active and engaged faculty.</p>"
