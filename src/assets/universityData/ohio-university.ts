            data: "<p><b>Ohio University</b> is the oldest institution of higher education in the state of Ohio. Founded in 1804, it was the first university chartered by an Act of Congress of the newly formed United States. It was also the first state university established in the Northwest Territory. The university traces its founding to an act of the Northwest Territorial Legislature in 1797, which authorized the establishment of an 'American Western University' in the town of Athens, Ohio.</p> <p>Since its founding, Ohio University has grown from a small, regional institution of fewer than 500 students to a comprehensive public university with more than 35,000 students spread across its five campuses. Ohio University offers more than 250 undergraduate majors and 200 graduate degree programs, making it one of the largest public universities in Ohio. The university also boasts a wide array of research centers and institutes, including the Ohio University Innovation Center, the Avionics Engineering Center, the Scripps Gerontology Center and the Institute for the Study of the Environment and Society.</p> <p>Ohio University has a long and storied history. Among its many accomplishments, it was the first public university to admit women, the first public university to offer a branch campus, and the first public university to offer an engineering program. It was also the first public university to offer courses in African American history and women's studies, and it was the first public university to be designated a 'green campus' by the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, Ohio University is home to the Ohio University Press, the oldest university press in the United States.</p>"
