            data: "<p><b>Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)</b> is a private research university in Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1865 in Worcester, WPI was one of the United States' first engineering and technology universities. It was founded as a small textile school and has since grown into a top-ranked engineering and technology university.</p> <p>WPI's history as an educational institution began in 1865, when the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science was founded. The Institute was created by a group of local businessmen led by Ichabod Washburn, owner of the Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company, and was dedicated to the advancement of the industrial arts and sciences. The school offered courses in the sciences and mathematics, and had a laboratory for experimental work in chemistry, mechanics, and electricity.</p> <p>In 1868, the Institute merged with the Worcester County Mechanics Institute and the Worcester City Art Museum to form the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The Institute was dedicated to the advancement of engineering and technology education, and was the first of its kind in the United States.</p> <p>In the early years, the Institute offered a wide range of courses, from mathematics and chemistry to engineering and mechanical drawing. In the 1870s, WPI began to focus more on engineering, and in 1885 the first Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering was awarded.</p> <p>Throughout the 20th century, WPI continued to grow and expand its programs. In 1950, the university was granted a charter to become a non-profit educational institution. In the 1960s and 1970s, WPI began to move away from its focus on engineering and technology and began to offer courses in the liberal arts and sciences.</p> <p>Today, WPI is a top-ranked university that offers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in engineering, science, humanities and arts, business, and social sciences. WPI is known for its innovative and interdisciplinary approach to education, and its commitment to developing professionals who are prepared to lead in the 21st century.</p>"
