            data: "<p>Hogan Hall at <b>West Virginia University Institute of Technology (WVU Tech)</b> first opened its doors in 1927, and is the oldest building on campus. The building was named after former WVU Tech President, Dr. James H. Hogan, who served from 1922 to 1933. The building was a symbol of the growth and development of the college, and was a state-of-the-art facility when it opened. It was initially used as a dormitory, but now serves as an administrative building housing the offices of the President, Provost, and other departments. The building has been renovated multiple times over the years to keep up with the changing needs of the college. In 2017, the building underwent a $2.2 million renovation to make it more energy efficient and modern. The renovation included the installation of geothermal heating and cooling, new windows, and upgrades to the building's exterior.</p>"
