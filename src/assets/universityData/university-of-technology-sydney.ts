It began in 1833 as the Sydney Mechanicsâ€™ School of Arts, providing evening classes for working people. In 1878, the school became the first in Australia to introduce a system of free public night classes.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, the school's focus shifted from night classes to vocational education, and in 1911 it was renamed the Sydney Technical College. The college continued to expand over the following decades, becoming the Sydney Institute of Technology in 1965. The institute soon began offering degree programs and in 1988, it officially became the University of Technology Sydney.</p> <p>Today, UTS is one of Australia's most innovative and progressive universities, providing research-led education and training to students from all over the world. The university offers more than 130 undergraduate and 210 postgraduate courses across its seven faculties, built on the foundation of its pioneering history.</p>"
