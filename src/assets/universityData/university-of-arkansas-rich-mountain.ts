The college was established as a two-year, open-admissions institution of higher education by the Arkansas General Assembly to serve the residents of Polk, Scott, and parts of Montgomery and Sebastian Counties. The college was created to meet the educational needs of rural western Arkansas and to provide occupational and technical training opportunities to the citizens of the region.</p> <p>In 1987, the Arkansas General Assembly authorized RMCC to offer baccalaureate degrees, and the college was renamed the University of Arkansas Rich Mountain (UARM). The college's mission was revised to expand educational opportunities to include baccalaureate programs and to provide students with the opportunities to pursue studies in the liberal arts and sciences. In 2015, UARM began offering its first master's degree, a Master of Science in Nursing. UARM remains committed to its mission of providing access to quality higher education to the citizens of rural western Arkansas.</p>"
