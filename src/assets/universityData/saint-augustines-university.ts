It is the oldest HBCU in the state and one of the oldest in the country.</p> <p>SAU was founded in 1867 by the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina as an all-male school. It was originally named Saint Augustine's Normal School and Collegiate Institute. The school was established to educate newly-freed African Americans in the aftermath of the Civil War. The institution was deliberately founded by Episcopalians to provide educational opportunities to African Americans and to minister to the spiritual needs of the African American community.</p> <p>In 1893, Saint Augustine’s Normal School and Collegiate Institute was reorganized and renamed Saint Augustine’s College. The school was chartered by the state of North Carolina and began to offer higher education courses such as theology, teacher education, liberal arts, and science. The college was founded on the principles of Christian education to promote the intellectual, moral, and spiritual development of its students.</p> <p>In 1921, Saint Augustine's College became the first HBCU to offer a four-year degree program. In 1927, the college became an accredited four-year college with the authority to confer Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.</p> <p>In 2012, Saint Augustine’s College was reorganized and renamed Saint Augustine’s University. The university now offers bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees. It continues to focus on providing quality education and spiritual formation to its students.</p>"
