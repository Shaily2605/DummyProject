Located in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the Twin Cities, the University of Minnesota was the first public university in the state and the only public university at the time. The university was made possible by the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862, which provided federal funds for public universities in each state. Initially, the university was focused on agriculture and engineering and today, it is a comprehensive university with 19 colleges and schools offering a wide range of academic programs. In addition to its main campuses, the university also has a number of satellite campuses throughout the state. Over the years, the university has grown and expanded, and today, it is a leading research university in the United States. It is home to more than 50,000 students, making it one of the largest universities in the country.</p>"
