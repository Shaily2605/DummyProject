            data: "<p><b>Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC)</b> is located in Truro, Nova Scotia. It is the oldest agricultural college in Canada and was founded in 1905. The college has a long and rich history as a leader in agricultural education and research in the Atlantic region.</p> <p>NSAC began as a two-year diploma program in dairying and animal husbandry, and in 1911 it was expanded to a three-year collegiate course. In 1923 the college was granted degree-granting status, and the first Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees were awarded in 1925.</p> <p>In 1969, NSAC merged with the Nova Scotia Technical College (established in 1960) to form the Nova Scotia Institute of Technology (NSIT). In 1971, the Nova Scotia Institute of Agriculture (NSIA) was created as a separate entity, and NSAC returned to its original purpose of offering post-secondary education in agriculture.</p> <p>Today, NSAC is a modern institution that is focused on providing high-quality education in the areas of agricultural sciences, environmental sciences, and business. The college offers a range of academic programs, from certificates and diplomas to undergraduate and graduate degrees, as well as specialized programs for international students. NSAC also provides research and extension services to help farmers and the agricultural industry in the province.</p>"
