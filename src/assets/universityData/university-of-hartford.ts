            data: "<p>The <b>University of Hartford</b> was founded in 1877 as the Hartford Art School, making it the first art school in Connecticut. It was established by a group of local art enthusiasts, led by Harriet Beecher Stowe and Daniel Wadsworth. In 1939, the school was renamed the Hartford School of Music, and then in 1957, the school was incorporated as the Hartt College of Music. In 1961, the school expanded its curriculum to include other fields of study and changed its name to the University of Hartford. In the late 1960s, the school added a College of Engineering and a College of Arts and Sciences, and continued to expand its course offerings in the following decades. Today, the University of Hartford offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs in seven schools and colleges.</p>"
