            data: "<p>The <b>Pavillon J.-Raymond-Frenette</b> is an historic building located in the city of Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada. The building was constructed in 1936 and was originally used as a meeting hall, banquet facility, and recreational center. In the 1940s, it was transformed into a community center, where people could gather for activities such as dancing, boxing, and wrestling. The building was named in honour of Joseph-Raymond Frenette, a local politician and businessman who was instrumental in the development of the facility. In the 1950s, the building was used as a school for the deaf and hard of hearing. In 1967, the building was purchased by the city and served as a community centre until the late 1990s, when it was renovated and converted into a museum and library. Today, the Pavillon J.-Raymond-Frenette is open to the public and houses a variety of exhibits, including artifacts from the region's history.</p>"
