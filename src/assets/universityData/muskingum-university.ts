            data: "<p><b>Muskingum University</b> is a private liberal arts college located in New Concord, Ohio. Founded in 1837, Muskingum University is one of the oldest universities in Ohio. The university was originally founded by the Presbyterian Church and is now affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). The university's mission is to 'provide an excellent undergraduate education in the liberal arts, sciences and professional studies, as well as valuable experience in research, internship, and service.'</p> <p>The university was first established as Muskingum Academy in 1837 by the Muskingum College Association, which was formed to provide higher education in the area. The original charter was granted by the Ohio General Assembly in 1845, and the college opened its doors to students in 1847. The college was named after the Muskingum River, which was in turn named after the Native American tribe of the same name that once inhabited the area.</p> <p>In 1865, the college was renamed Muskingum University and granted a degree-granting charter by the state of Ohio. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the university continued to expand and added new programs, such as the first college-level nursing program in the state of Ohio. In the 1960s, Muskingum University experienced a major expansion, with the construction of several new buildings and the addition of a number of new academic programs. Today, Muskingum University offers more than 50 undergraduate majors, as well as master's degrees in education, business, and nursing.</p>"
