            data: "<p><b>Naropa University</b> is an American private university in Boulder, Colorado. Founded in 1974 as Naropa Institute by Buddhist, poet, and peace activist Allen Ginsberg and Tibetan teacher Chögyam Trungpa, it is the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired university in the United States. The university is named for an 11th-century Indian Buddhist sage, Naropa, an abbot of Nalanda University and the teacher of Marpa Lotsawa, who brought the teachings of Buddhism to Tibet. Naropa describes itself as nonsectarian, rather drawing from various belief systems and wisdom traditions.</p> <p>Naropa Institute was founded in 1974 with the support of the Shambhala Buddhist community and many of its members. Its founders sought to bring together Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, and create a program that would provide students with an education that would address both academic and contemplative disciplines. In its early years, Naropa was a center for the countercultural and spiritual movements of the 1970s, and many of its faculty and students were associated with those movements.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the institute began to formalize its administration and educational programs and developed a Board of Trustees. In 1988, Naropa Institute was granted accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1989, it changed its name to Naropa University. The university has since grown to include several degree programs, including undergraduate and graduate degrees in a variety of disciplines.</p>"
