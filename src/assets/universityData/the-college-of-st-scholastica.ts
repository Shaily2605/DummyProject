            data: "<p><b>The College of St. Scholastica</b> is an independent private college located in Duluth, Minnesota, USA. Founded in 1912 by a group of pioneering Benedictine Sisters, the college has grown from a small Catholic liberal arts school to a nationally-recognized institution with a full range of degree programs in the arts, sciences, business, and health sciences.</p> <p>The college was established in response to the need for higher education in the area. The first classes were held in September 1912 in a rented house, with just 18 students. In 1914, the college moved to its current location in Duluth and the main building, Tower Hall, was opened. In the 1920s, the college began to expand its curriculum, adding programs in business, nursing, and education.</p> <p>Since then, the college has continued to expand and now offers more than 80 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degree programs. The college has also become an important contributor to the local community, providing educational, cultural, and social services. In the past decade, the college has increased its endowment, established a global education program, and built new facilities.</p> <p>Today, the College of St. Scholastica is known for its commitment to academic excellence, social justice, and service to the community. The college continues to provide its students with an education that combines the Benedictine tradition of faith and learning with the latest in technology and research.</p>"
