            data: "<p>The <b>University of Massachusetts Amherst</b> was founded in 1863, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act. This act established the nation's first public higher education institution that was designed to provide educational opportunities to students regardless of race, gender, or socio-economic status. The University of Massachusetts Amherst opened its doors to students in 1867, and since then, has become one of the largest universities in the United States. The university underwent a massive expansion during the 1970s and 1980s, adding numerous new facilities, including a research library, student center, and classrooms. The university has since become a major research institution, focusing on fields such as engineering, computer science, and business. In addition, the university has a vibrant student life, with over 20,000 students enrolled annually.</p>"
