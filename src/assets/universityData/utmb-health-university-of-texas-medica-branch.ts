Founded in 1891, UTMB has a long and distinguished history of innovative education, research, patient care and public service. Throughout its history, UTMB has played an important role in the development of health care in Texas and beyond.</p> <p>In 1891, the Texas Legislature established UTMB as the first public medical school in the state, with the mission of creating a medical school, a teaching hospital and public health programs. The school was initially located in the city of Galveston, and the hospital and medical school were combined into one entity. The school was originally known as the University of Texas Medical Department, and was part of the University of Texas System.</p> <p>In the early years, UTMB focused on training medical students, providing care to patients and conducting research. The school was also a leader in public health initiatives, such as health education, disease prevention, and health care access.</p> <p>In the late 1960s and 1970s, UTMB underwent a period of rapid growth and expansion. The school added new programs, such as nursing and allied health care, and established a graduate school of biomedical sciences. UTMB also opened several new facilities, including the Shriners Burns Hospital, the Moody Medical Library and the UTMB Sealy Center for Vaccine Development.</p> <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, UTMB continued to expand its educational and research programs, opening the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, the Institute for Translational Sciences, and the Sealy Center for Environmental Health and Medicine. UTMB also established several new clinical services, including the Cancer Center, the Heart Institute and the Institute for Reconstructive Sciences in Medicine.</p> <p>Today, UTMB is a leading academic health center, providing patient care, education and research in a wide range of medical specialties. The school also continues to provide public health services and to be a leader in health care innovation and policy.</p>"
