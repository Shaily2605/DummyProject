Founded in 1959, York is one of Canada’s leading post-secondary institutions, offering over 300 degree programs and 11,000 courses. York’s main campus consists of eleven faculties and schools, including the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies, the Lassonde School of Engineering, and the Schulich School of Business.</p> <p>The history of York University dates back to the late 1950s when the provincial government of Ontario made the decision to create a second university in the Greater Toronto Area. In 1959, the University of Toronto’s Erindale College was established as a separate entity, and in 1960 it officially became York University. The original campus was located on a rural property in North York, Ontario, and the first classes were held in the fall of 1961.</p> <p>Since then, York has grown significantly, with additional campuses in Glendon, Markham, and Keele. York also has a large student body, with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled. The university has also developed a strong research profile, with a focus on human rights, health, and social policy.</p> <p>York University is now one of Canada’s leading universities, and it has made a significant impact on the Greater Toronto Area. In addition to offering a wide range of educational opportunities, York has also established itself as a leader in research, innovation, and community engagement.</p>"
