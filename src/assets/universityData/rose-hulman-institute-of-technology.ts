            data: "<p><b>Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</b> is a private, undergraduate-only engineering college located in Terre Haute, Indiana. Founded in 1874 as the Terre Haute School of Industrial Sciences, the college has grown from its roots in mechanical engineering to encompass a broad array of engineering, mathematics, and science programs. Rose-Hulman is known for its rigorous academic standards and its commitment to providing students with a hands-on education.</p> <p>The school was founded by Chauncey Rose, a successful Terre Haute businessman, and Amos Hulman Jr., a prominent local attorney, as the Terre Haute School of Industrial Sciences. The two men envisioned a college that would offer students the best in engineering and science education and provide the local community with a strong workforce.</p> <p>In 1901, the school was renamed Rose Polytechnic Institute in honor of Chauncey Rose. Over the following decades, the school continued to expand its offerings, adding new engineering and science programs and establishing a strong reputation for academic excellence. In 1971, the school was renamed Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology to honor both founders.</p> <p>Today, Rose-Hulman is a highly-regarded institution of higher learning, offering students a comprehensive education in engineering, science, and mathematics. The college has been consistently ranked as one of the top undergraduate engineering schools in the nation and has produced numerous successful graduates.</p>"
