            data: "<p><b>Okanagan College Kelowna Campus</b> opened in 1967 as the Okanagan University College (OUC). It was created in response to the need for post-secondary education in the Okanagan Valley and the surrounding area. The College was a partnership between the provincial government, the University of British Columbia (UBC), and the local community. OUC began offering programs in the arts, sciences, and business.</p> <p>In 1970, OUC opened the Kelowna campus, located on a hill which overlooks the city. At the time, the campus was comprised of a library, a student centre, a residence, and several classrooms.</p> <p>In 1974, the College was granted full autonomy and changed its name to Okanagan College. In the years that followed, the campus underwent a major expansion, adding a number of new buildings and facilities, such as a trades and technology centre and a health sciences centre.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Okanagan College began to expand its educational offerings, introducing new programs in areas such as nursing, hospitality, and tourism. In addition, the College established partnerships with other post-secondary institutions to offer joint degree programs.</p> <p>Today, Okanagan College Kelowna Campus is a thriving hub of education, offering a wide range of programs and services to students.</p>"
