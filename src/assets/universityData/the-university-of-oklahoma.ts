            data: "<p><b>The University of Oklahoma (OU)</b> was established in 1890, making it one of the oldest public universities in the United States. It began as the Oklahoma Territorial University, established just prior to the state of Oklahoma being admitted to the Union. The university was originally located in downtown Norman, Oklahoma, and has since expanded to encompass several campuses throughout the state.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, the University of Oklahoma underwent a period of great growth and expansion. The University built its first library in 1903, and the College of Arts and Sciences was established in 1907. OU's first president, William Bennett Bizzell, was appointed in 1908 and oversaw the University's first major building projects, which included the construction of dormitories, a student union, and a library.</p> <p>In 1920, the University opened its School of Law, and in 1929, the University's Medical College was established. The University also established a School of Engineering in the 1930s, and in 1948, the College of Business Administration was established.</p> <p>Throughout the 1960s and 70s, the University of Oklahoma underwent a period of further expansion, with the addition of new schools and colleges and the construction of new facilities. In 1971, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education granted the university autonomy, allowing it to make its own decisions regarding curricula and tuition.</p> <p>Today, the University of Oklahoma is a major public research university, with more than 40,000 students enrolled. It offers over 150 majors and degrees in a variety of fields, and is ranked among the top public universities in the United States.</p>"
