            data: "<p><b>Saint John's University (SJU)</b> is a private Roman Catholic university in Collegeville, Minnesota. The school was founded in 1857 by the Order of Saint Benedict and currently has over 2,300 students representing over 60 countries. The university is known for its focus on liberal arts education and its Benedictine values of hospitality, stewardship, justice, and respect.</p> <p>The idea for the school originated with Archbishop John Ireland, who appealed to the Benedictines to create a Catholic college in Minnesota. The school opened in 1857 with just three students and one professor, and it has grown steadily since then. Over the last 160 years, the university has grown to be a leading institution in the Midwest, offering undergraduate and graduate programs in a variety of disciplines.</p> <p>SJU has a long history of excellence in athletics, with its football team winning several national championships in the past century. In addition, the university's teams have had a great deal of success in NCAA Division III competition. SJU is also home to several prominent alumni, including former Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson and former NFL player and coach Bud Grant.</p>"
