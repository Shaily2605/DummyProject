            data: "<p>The <b>University of Divinity</b> is the only university in Australia that is dedicated exclusively to theological education and research. It was founded in 1910, when the Victorian Parliament passed the Melbourne College of Divinity Act, which established the Melbourne College of Divinity (MCD). The MCD was the first private theological college in Australia and the first college to offer degrees in the country.</p> <p>The MCD was initially composed of seven denominational colleges, each with its own faculty of theology and staff. The colleges included Melbourne College of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, the Wesley College of the Methodist Church of Australasia, the Anglican Church's Ridley College, the Baptist Theological College of Victoria, the Congregational Church's Parkin College, the Unitarian Church's Ormond College and the Lutheran Theological College of Victoria.</p> <p>In 1991, the MCD became the University of Divinity, when the Victorian Parliament passed the University of Divinity Act. This Act provided for the incorporation of the MCD into the University of Divinity, which was established as a federated university. The University of Divinity is the successor to the MCD, and it retains the same seven denominational colleges.</p> <p>Today, the University of Divinity offers a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, as well as professional and research degrees. It also offers a range of advanced study and research opportunities, including doctoral degrees, research fellowships and postdoctoral research programs. The University of Divinity is a member of the International Association of Universities and the Australian Council of Deans of Theology.</p>"
