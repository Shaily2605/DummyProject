            data: "<p><b>St Brendan-Shaw College</b> is a Catholic co-educational college located in Burnie, Tasmania. The college was established in 1995 as a merger between St Brendan's College and St Mary's College. The college was named after the two founding schools, St Brendan and St Mary.</p> <p>The two schools had a long history prior to the merger. St Brendan’s College was established in 1948 as an extension of St Brendan’s parish. It was mainly staffed by Christian Brothers and provided Catholic education to boys from grades 7-10. The school was later renamed St Brendan’s College when it began to offer education to girls in 1975.</p> <p>St Mary’s College was founded in 1868, as an extension of St Mary’s parish. Originally an all-girls school, it provided Catholic education to girls from grades 7-12. The school was later upgraded to a senior college and began to offer education to boys in 1983.</p> <p>In 1995, St Brendan’s and St Mary’s merged, forming St Brendan-Shaw College. The college was the first school in Tasmania to offer a full range of Catholic education for grades 7-12, and is still going strong today.</p>"
