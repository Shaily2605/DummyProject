            data: "<p><b>Mississippi University for Women (MUW)</b> was founded in 1884 as the first public college for women in the United States. The college was established under the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1862 which provided endowments to states for the establishment of colleges to teach agricultural and mechanical sciences. The college opened its doors to students in 1885 and is the oldest public university for women in the United States.</p> <p>The first classes were held in a two-story brick building on Main Street in Columbus, Mississippi. The college offered courses in the arts and sciences, teacher training, and industrial arts. The college was renamed Mississippi State College for Women in 1920 and was designated as a senior college in 1924.</p> <p>In 1982, Mississippi State College for Women was renamed Mississippi University for Women (MUW) and its mission was expanded to include graduate education. In 1995, MUW became the first public university in the United States to make the transition from a single-sex college to a coeducational university. Today, MUW is a comprehensive public university offering bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in more than thirty areas of study.</p>"
