Partridge was a strong advocate of education and training for military preparedness. He believed that a military academy should provide 'a thorough and practical education for the sons of gentlemen.'</p> <p>The school initially offered a three-year course that included literature, mathematics, natural philosophy, and military tactics. As the school grew, more courses were added, including engineering, military engineering, civil engineering, chemistry, and law.</p> <p>In 1834, the school was renamed Norwich University in honor of its patron, the Earl of Norwich. During this period, the university established a law school, a medical school, and a school of science.</p> <p>During the Civil War, the university closed its doors and many of its students joined the Union Army. The university reopened in 1870 and continued to grow, adding new programs and departments.</p> <p>Today, Norwich University is the oldest private military college in the United States and the birthplace of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC).
