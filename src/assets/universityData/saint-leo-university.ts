Founded in 1889, it is the oldest Catholic college in Florida and the state's first four-year institution of higher learning. It is associated with the Holy Name Monastery, a Benedictine convent founded in 1883.</p> <p>Saint Leo College was founded in 1889 by Abbot Jerome and Brother Leo, two Benedictine monks from Pennsylvania. The college was initially established to educate the children of the monks, but it quickly expanded to offer a liberal arts education to the local community. In 1916, the school was chartered by the state of Florida and became Saint Leo College. In 1973, the school was renamed Saint Leo University to reflect its commitment to offering advanced degree programs.</p> <p>Today, Saint Leo University is a private, Roman Catholic liberal arts university that offers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The university is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and its business programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs.
