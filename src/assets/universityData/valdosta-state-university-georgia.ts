            data: "<p><b>Valdosta State University</b> was founded in 1906 as a private college by the Methodist Church and was known as South Georgia State Normal College. It was initially founded to train teachers to serve in the schools of south Georgia. In 1913, the college was taken over by the state of Georgia and renamed Georgia State College for Women. The college was then moved to its current location in the city of Valdosta and renamed Valdosta State College.</p> <p>In 1950, the college was renamed Valdosta State College and began offering more degree programs and expanding its enrollment. In the 1960s, the college began offering graduate degrees, and in 1993, it was granted university status and renamed Valdosta State University.</p> <p>Since then, VSU has continued to grow and now offers more than 100 degree programs. In addition to offering traditional classes and programs, VSU also offers online degrees, continuing education, and professional development courses. The university is also home to the Hugh C. Bailey Library, the VSU Planetarium, and the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Leadership.</p>"
