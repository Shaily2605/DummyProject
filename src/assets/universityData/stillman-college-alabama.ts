            data: "<p><b>Stillman College</b> is a historically black liberal arts college located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Founded in 1876 as a school for freed slaves, the college was initially named Tuscaloosa Institute. In 1877, the school was renamed Stillman Institute in honor of Dr. Charles Allen Stillman, a benefactor and one of the school's founders. The school offered its first four-year degree program in 1899. The college merged with the Tuscaloosa Theological Institute in 1902, and the school was renamed Stillman College. In the mid-20th century, Stillman College was a major center of the civil rights movement. In 1954, students held a sit-in at the local Woolworth's to protest segregation, and in 1965, students participated in the Selma to Montgomery march led by Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, Stillman College is a four-year liberal arts college offering bachelor's degrees in fields such as business administration, education, and social work.</p>"
