            data: "<p><b>Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)</b> was founded in 1932 as a private, non-profit institution of higher learning in Hooksett, New Hampshire. The university was originally known as the New Hampshire School of Accounting and Secretarial Science and was founded by Harry A.B. Shapiro, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who was eager to bring the school's accounting and business education to the people of New England.</p> <p>In the 1950s, the school expanded its curriculum to include a wide range of liberal arts, business, and technology courses. In 1963, the school became an accredited four-year institution, and in 1974, it became a university.</p> <p>Today, SNHU is a nationally-recognized, regionally-accredited private university with more than 3,000 on-campus students and over 80,000 online students.
