            data: "<p><b>Swarthmore College</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles southwest of Philadelphia. Founded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. It was established by a committee of Quakers, led by Lucretia Mott and supported by the Hicksite branch of the Religious Society of Friends. The college was founded to provide a quality education for members of the Friends who had limited access to higher education.</p> <p>The college was the first to have an all-female board of trustees, the first to have an all-female student government, and the first to have an all-female faculty. Swarthmore was also the first college in the United States to have a student-run honor code. Swarthmore is still a Quaker-affiliated college, and the college still embraces the values of the Religious Society of Friends.</p> <p>Swarthmore is known for its rigorous academic programs and its strong commitment to social justice. The college has consistently been ranked among the top liberal arts colleges in the United States. In 2021, Swarthmore was ranked fifth among national liberal arts colleges by U.S. News & World Report.</p>"
