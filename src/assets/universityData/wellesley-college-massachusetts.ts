The college was originally housed in the Durant's home in Wellesley Hills.</p> <p>In 1875, the college moved to its present location, a 500-acre estate donated by the Durants. The campus was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the same landscape architect who designed Central Park in New York City.</p> <p>The college has grown steadily over the years, and now enrolls 2,400 undergraduate students from all 50 states and over 75 countries. Wellesley is consistently ranked as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the country.</p>"
