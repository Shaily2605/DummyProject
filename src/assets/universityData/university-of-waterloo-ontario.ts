            data: "<p>The <b>University of Waterloo</b> was founded in 1957, by Dr. Gerry Hagey, a local businessman and the first president of the university. It was the first university to be established in Ontario after the Second World War. It was initially a non-denominational university, but it later received financial backing from the United Church of Canada.</p> <p>The University of Waterloo initially focused on applied science and engineering, but it now offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of subjects, including arts, business, education, environment, health, science and technology. In 1967, the University of Waterloo established the Faculty of Mathematics, which is now the largest mathematics department in North America.</p> <p>In the late 1960s, the university began to offer cooperative education programs, which allow students to gain work experience while they study. This innovation has been widely adopted by universities around the world, and it has helped the University of Waterloo become one of the most highly-regarded universities in Canada.</p> <p>The University of Waterloo has also been at the forefront of research and innovation. It is home to several world-class research centres, including the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, the Institute for Quantum Computing, and the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology. In addition to its research, the University of Waterloo has established several successful start-up companies, including BlackBerry and Open Text Corporation.</p> <p>Today, the University of Waterloo is a thriving research institution with more than 35,000 students and over 6,000 faculty and staff. It is consistently ranked as one of the top universities in Canada, and it has become an important part of the academic landscape in Ontario.</p>"
