            data: "<p><b>Monbulk College</b> is a government secondary school in Monbulk, Victoria, Australia. Established in 1961, it has an enrolment of 539 students from Year 7 to 12.</p> <p>The school was established in 1961 as the Monbulk High School, originally housed in a two-storey bluestone building that was constructed in the late 19th century. Initially, the school had only two classrooms, a library, a staff room and an office. In the late 1960s, a new building was built to accommodate more students, and it was officially opened by the then State Education Minister in 1970.</p> <p>Since then, the school has undergone several upgrades and renovations, including a new gymnasium, library, and other facilities. In the mid-1990s, the school was renamed Monbulk College to reflect its growing status as a comprehensive secondary school. A new wing was added in 2000, and the school underwent a major redevelopment in 2004-2006.</p> <p>Today, Monbulk College is a vibrant and dynamic learning community, offering a diverse range of educational and co-curricular programs. It is well regarded in the local area and is an important hub of learning and community engagement.</p>"
