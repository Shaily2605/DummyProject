            data: "<p><b>Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA)</b> is a public university located in Nacogdoches, Texas. It was founded as a teachers college in 1923 and is named after Stephen F. Austin, the 'Father of Texas'.</p> <p>The university began as a result of a bill passed by the Texas State Legislature in 1921. The bill authorized the creation of a teachers college in Nacogdoches and the purchase of the Nacogdoches Male and Female College, which had been operating since 1859. In 1923, the college opened its doors with six faculty members and 148 students.</p> <p>The early years of the college focused on the teaching profession, and the college was known as the Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College. In 1951, the college was renamed Stephen F. Austin State College, and in 1969 it became Stephen F. Austin State University.</p> <p>Today, SFA is a comprehensive university offering more than 120 degree programs to nearly 13,000 students. It is the largest public university in East Texas and offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs.
