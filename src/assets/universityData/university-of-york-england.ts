The university is a member of the Russell Group, an association of top UK research-intensive universities. The University is organized into nine colleges and offers more than 200 undergraduate and postgraduate courses.</p> <p>The University of York has a long and distinguished history. It began in the 1840s, when a group of Yorkshire Quakers founded York Mechanics Institute, the first purpose-built adult education college in the UK. In the late 1950s, the institute became part of the University of Hull and was renamed University College York. In 1963, the college became autonomous and was granted its own Royal Charter, becoming the University of York.</p> <p>Since then, the University has grown significantly, with more than 20,000 students enrolled and more than 6,000 staff. It is home to several world-class research institutes and centres of excellence, including the Centre for Applied Systems Analysis, the Institute for Social Futures and the York Law School. The University also has an excellent reputation for its teaching, with consistently high ratings in the National Student Survey and numerous awards for excellence in teaching and research.</p>"
