            data: "<p><b>Rider University</b> was founded in 1865 in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. The university's founders were Henry Beadman Bryant and Henry H. Hicks, two Methodist ministers, who wanted to create a school that would provide a quality educational opportunity to the working class. The school was initially known as the Trenton Commercial College, and its first classes began in 1868 with just 13 students.</p> <p>In 1893, the college was reorganized and renamed Rider College, in honor of the Reverend and Mrs. John W. Rider, who had provided the land and funding for the campus. In the early 1900s, Rider College added new academic programs, including a law school and a business school, and by the 1950s, the college had grown to include a full liberal arts curriculum.</p> <p>In the 1960s, Rider College became a university, and changed its name to Rider University. The university began to expand its campus and curriculum, adding new graduate programs and facilities. In the 2000s, Rider University continued to grow, adding additional degree programs and student services. Today, Rider University is a comprehensive, private university offering more than 60 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to its students.</p>"
