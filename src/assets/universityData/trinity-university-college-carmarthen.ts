            data: "<p><b>Trinity University College</b> (formerly Trinity College Carmarthen) is an educational institution in Carmarthen, Wales. It was founded in 1848 by the Church of England as a theological college to train Anglican priests. Initially a small college, it grew rapidly in the early 20th century and, in the 1950s, the decision was taken to become a multi-disciplinary college offering a wide range of non-theological courses.</p> <p>Since then, it has developed further and, in 2008, became an independent higher education institution, changing its name to Trinity University College. It offers higher education courses in a wide range of subject areas including nursing, health and social care, sports, music, education, business, computing and media. It is also home to the National Centre for Rural Health and Care, a virtual centre of excellence offering courses and research in rural health and care.</p> <p>Today, the college is part of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, a university with campuses in Carmarthen, Lampeter and Swansea. It is a recognised centre for excellence in teaching and learning, and is committed to providing quality education and training for its students.</p>"
