            data: "<p><b>Seattle University</b> is a private Jesuit Catholic university located in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1891, it is the largest independent university in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p> <p>The university's history dates back to 1891, when the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) founded the school as the 'Aloysius College' in downtown Seattle. The college was named for St. Aloysius Gonzaga, an Italian Jesuit who dedicated his life to the care of the sick and the poor. The college was founded to provide a quality education for the young people of the city's emerging immigrant population.</p> <p>In 1909, the college moved to its current location on Capitol Hill, where it was renamed Seattle College. In 1931, the school was renamed Seattle University and granted university status.</p> <p>In 1948, the school became co-educational when it opened its doors to women. Today, Seattle University is a thriving community of more than 7,000 students, representing every state in the U.S. and more than 50 countries. The university offers more than 80 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the liberal arts, sciences, business, education, engineering, nursing, and law.</p>"
