            data: "<p>The <b>University of New Mexico Los Alamos (UNMLA)</b> began as Los Alamos Community College in 1965. It was created to provide educational opportunities to the people of northern New Mexico at a time when higher education was not easily accessible. Initially, the college operated out of a small building in the town of Los Alamos.</p> <p>In 1969, the college was absorbed into the University of New Mexico and became UNMLA. The college was initially known as the Los Alamos Campus of the University of New Mexico, but it was later changed to the University of New Mexico Los Alamos.</p> <p>In the early days, UNMLA offered classes in basic academic subjects, including English, math, and science. It was not until 1984 that the college began offering degree programs. Today, UNMLA offers Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Associate of Applied Science degrees as well as a number of certificate programs. The college also offers classes in a range of disciplines including business, computer science, engineering, and liberal arts.</p> <p>UNMLA has grown significantly since its founding. The college now has over 1,500 students and offers more than 30 degree and certificate programs. The college also has a branch campus in Espanola, New Mexico, and operates the UNM-LA Science and Technology Park.</p>"
