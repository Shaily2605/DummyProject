            data: "<p>The <b>Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE)</b> is a private, non-profit university located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, founded in 1903 by Oscar Werwath. It is one of the oldest engineering schools in the Midwest, and the only one in Wisconsin.</p> <p>MSOE's focus on engineering and business was established in 1903 when the Milwaukee YMCA's school of engineering was turned over to the Milwaukee YMCA's board of trustees. The school was then renamed the Milwaukee School of Engineering. It was the first school in the United States to offer a degree in engineering. The school was known as the Milwaukee YMCA College until 1996 when it changed its name to the Milwaukee School of Engineering.</p> <p>In its early years, MSOE offered two-year diploma programs in engineering and business. In 1928, the school began offering four-year degree programs in engineering and business. In 1933, MSOE was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and in 1936 the school was accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development (now the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).</p> <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, MSOE added new degree programs and began offering graduate-level programs. The school also continued to expand its campus, adding new buildings and facilities. In 1985, the school launched its first doctoral program, in Computer Science.</p> <p>Today, MSOE offers over 40 degree programs, including engineering, business, nursing, mathematics, health care, and construction management. The school also has a strong focus on research, including a number of research centers and labs.</p>"
