It was formed on 18 November 2010 from the merger of the University of Wales Lampeter and Trinity University College.</p> <p>UWTSD can trace its roots back to 1822, when the first Yr Academi Frenhinol was founded in Lampeter, Ceredigion. The university was formally established in 2010 as part of a major restructuring of higher education in Wales. The Lampeter campus was established in 1822 when Bishop Burgess founded the first Yr Academi Frenhinol. In 1852 it became St David's College, being renamed as St David's University College in 1971, part of the federal University of Wales.</p> <p>In 2010, following restructuring of the University of Wales, St David's University College and Trinity University College merged to form the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. This new university brought together three campuses in Carmarthen, Lampeter and Swansea and provided the opportunity to develop a range of new courses, including the first BA Hons degree in English and Creative Writing.</p> <p>The University of Wales Trinity Saint David is an ambitious institution committed to providing an excellent student experience and to delivering high quality research. It is a major centre for the arts and humanities in Wales, and has a vibrant research culture. It is also home to a number of specialist research centres, including the Centre for Media and Culture, the Centre for Applied Research in Education and the Centre for Ethics and Law.</p>"
