            data: "<p>The <b>Pontifical College Josephinum</b> is a Roman Catholic seminary and school of theology for the education of priests located in Columbus, Ohio, United States. It is the only pontifical college in the United States.</p> <p>The college was founded on December 8, 1888, by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati as the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas of the Roman Curia. The college and seminary were designed to provide an education to young men considering a vocation to the priesthood, and to prepare them for the priesthood in the United States.</p> <p>In 1889, Pope Leo XIII granted the college a charter and named it the Pontifical College Josephinum in honor of Pope Pius IX. The college moved to its present location in Columbus in 1903. The Josephinum was made a pontifical university in 1923, and in 1924, it was entrusted to the Society of the Priests of St. Sulpice.</p> <p>Today, the Pontifical College Josephinum offers a four-year theology and philosophy program, which is recognized and approved by the Vatican, and is the only program of its kind in the United States. The college also offers a Master of Divinity degree, a Master of Arts in Theology, and a Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry.</p>"
