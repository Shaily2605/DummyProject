            data: "<p><b>Sinte Gleska University (SGU)</b> is a private, tribally-controlled university located on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. It is owned and operated by the Sicangu Oyate (the Rosebud Sioux Tribe). The university was founded in 1971 by then tribal chairman Frank Fools Crow and a group of tribal elders. It was the first tribally-controlled university in the United States and the first owned and operated by an American Indian nation.</p> <p>The university was originally established to provide education to the Sioux people of the Rosebud Reservation. Its original mission was to provide educational opportunities to tribal members who had limited access to higher education. Over the years, the mission of the university has evolved to include the preservation and promotion of Lakota culture and language, and the development of higher education programs.</p> <p>Sinte Gleska University grew steadily over the years and now offers Associate, Bachelor's, and Master's degrees in a variety of areas, including education, business, social work, and Lakota language and culture. The university has also developed a number of outreach initiatives, including the Sinte Gleska University Community Education Program, which offers a variety of courses and workshops to local residents.</p> <p>Today, Sinte Gleska University continues to serve the educational needs of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and the surrounding communities, and is a testament to the spirit and resilience of the Sioux people.</p>"
