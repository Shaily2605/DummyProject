            data: "<p><b>Suffolk University</b> is a private, non-profit institution of higher education located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 1906, it is the 8th oldest law school in the United States and is the only law school in Massachusetts with a public policy emphasis.</p> <p>In 1906, a group of prominent attorneys and civic leaders established the Suffolk School of Law. The school was named after Massachusetts’s first governor, John Hancock, who had served as a chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. The school began with 28 students and a faculty of three. In 1907, the school was incorporated and the founders acquired a building on Beacon Hill, which remains the school’s home today.</p> <p>In 1937, the name of the school was changed to Suffolk University. The school subsequently expanded its offerings to include undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees. In 1944, the school added a business school and in 1950, the school launched its first graduate program.</p> <p>Since its founding, the university has grown to become one of the largest independent universities in the United States, enrolling over 8,000 students from over 100 countries. The university offers more than 200 academic programs, including over 50 undergraduate majors, more than 60 graduate programs, and a number of professional degree programs.</p> <p>Suffolk University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE) and is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).</p>"
