It is one of the oldest universities in the United States and is often considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world.</p> <p>The university was founded as the Collegiate School by a group of Congregationalist ministers and scholars in what was then the Colony of Connecticut. The school was renamed Yale College in 1718 after a generous donation from Elihu Yale, a wealthy British merchant. In 1745, Yale College received a charter from the British Crown, making it the first college in the colonies to be granted a royal charter.</p> <p>Yale was at the center of the American Enlightenment during the 18th century. It was during this period that the university's first medical school and graduate programs were established. In the 19th century, Yale expanded its curriculum to include the study of law, engineering, and the sciences, and saw a number of its graduates go on to become prominent leaders in business, politics, and the arts.</p> <p>Today, Yale is a major research university and is home to a number of highly respected professional schools including the Yale School of Medicine, the Yale School of Management, and the Yale Law School. The university is also home to numerous cultural institutions, including the Yale Center for British Art, the Yale Repertory Theatre, and the Yale Union.</p>"
