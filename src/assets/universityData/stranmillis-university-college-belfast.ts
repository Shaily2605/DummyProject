            data: "<p><b>Stranmillis University College</b> was founded in 1922 as a teacher training college in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The college was initially established to educate Protestant teachers, but by the 1930s it had become a mixed college with both Protestant and Catholic students. In the 1960s Stranmillis began to branch out, offering courses in fields such as social work, physical education and early childhood education.</p> <p>In the 1970s the college began to offer a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, becoming a full university college in 1983. In 2005 Stranmillis was granted degree-awarding powers by the Privy Council, and in 2008 the college became part of the Queen's University of Belfast.</p> <p>The college has continued to expand its range of courses, and today offers a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in areas such as education, social work, psychology, youth and community work, and sport and exercise science. Stranmillis is also home to the Northern Ireland Centre for Research in Child Care and Education, and the Institute of Professional Development.</p>"
