            data: "<p>The <b>University of St. Joseph’s College</b>, formerly known as the Collège Saint-Joseph, was founded in 1864 by Bishop Médéric-Joseph de Gourgay in Memramcook, New Brunswick. It was the first bilingual post-secondary institution in Canada and was dedicated to the education of French-speaking Roman Catholic clergy and laypeople. The school was initially administered by the Congregation of the Holy Cross, an international Roman Catholic Religious Order.</p> <p>In 1885, the college was re-established as the University of St. Joseph’s College and received full university status, allowing it to grant degrees in Arts and Science. The university also offered courses in theology, philosophy, and education.</p> <p>For more than a century, the University of St. Joseph’s College served as a French-speaking Catholic university, providing education to thousands of students. In 1968, the university joined with the Université de Moncton and the University of New Brunswick to form the Université de Moncton, a single university with three campuses. The University of St. Joseph’s College became the Moncton campus of the university, while the other campuses became the Moncton-Shippagan and Fredericton campuses.</p> <p>In 1971, the University of St. Joseph’s College was officially closed and the campus was sold to the Province of New Brunswick. The university’s library and archives were transferred to the Université de Moncton. Today, the building that housed the university is used as a retreat center.</p>"
