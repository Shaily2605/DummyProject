            data: "<p><b>Pfeiffer University</b> is a private university located in Misenheimer, North Carolina. It was founded in 1885 by Dr. John Christian Pfeiffer as the “Otto Schule”, a one-room schoolhouse serving the area’s German immigrant population. In 1891, Pfeiffer moved the school to its current location in Misenheimer and changed its name to the “John C. Pfeiffer Memorial Institute”. The school grew steadily over the decades, adding new buildings and programs. In 1960, it became a four-year college and was awarded university status in 1984. It has since grown to include five campuses in North Carolina, offering a range of undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs. Today, Pfeiffer University is a comprehensive institution that serves more than 2,000 students annually.</p>"
