The first NSCC President was Dr. John M. Savage.</p> <p>Since then, NSCC has grown to 13 campuses located in communities throughout the province, offering a wide variety of programs in the trades, technology, health, human services, business, and the creative industries.</p> <p>In 1995, NSCC began offering university transfer courses and in 1999, NSCC was granted the authority to grant degrees in partnership with universities. Today, students can earn a range of degrees at NSCC, including bachelor’s and associate's degrees, as well as diplomas and certificates.</p> <p>In 2019, NSCC launched a new brand identity and changed its name to Nova Scotia Community College (NSCECE). The new name is intended to reflect the college’s commitment to providing accessible and affordable education and its role in supporting the economic and social well-being of Nova Scotia.</p>"
